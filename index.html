                <p>My name is Edwin Barrack. I am currently a Junior at Virginia Tech with a declared major in

                    practices four times a week and competes against other universities in tournaments on weekends. I 
                    enjoy watching college and professional sports making the yearly March Madness brackets, and 
                    occasionally joining a fantasy football league. I also enjoy an occassional match of Rocket League 
                    and Clash Royale, or run of Hades and Dead Cells. Now that I am living alone at college, I have 
                    started learning how to play guitar and cook meals for myself. If you would like to get in touch,

                <h2>Experience</h2>
                <p>
                    I was introduced to volleyball by my family when I was 9 years old. My parents met through 
                    volleyball, and my sister was starting to play her first few seasons. Of course, I wanted to join 
                    in and started playing in a junior league at the age of 11. Almost 10 years later, I am still 
                    playing volleyball, including 7 years of travel volleyball, 6 seasons of high school volleyball, 
                    and 2 years of college club volleyball at Virginia Tech (placed fifth and third in those years). 
                    For the past 3 years, I have also begun refereeing volleyball at all levels at the 
                    <a href="https://www.rvc.net/">Richmond Volleyball Club (RVC).</a>
                    While working, I was able to understand the primary differences between 
                    beginner, intermediate, and advanced level players (as seen in Quick Help). This understanding and 
                    my overall experience are what inspired me to start coaching and build this website. Knowing that 
                    I can make someone better at the sport they love, in turn, makes me love the sport even more. I am 
                    so thankful to my family for raising me in this friendly environment, and I will gladly say, 
                    "Playing volleyball is the best decision I have ever made."

                <h3>Beginner Level</h3>
                <p>
                    The key for you to start scoring at the beginner level of volleyball is a good serve (I would 
                    recommend a low, overhand float serve). As a referee, I have seen many beginner level games 
                    decided by one or two long runs (a streak of points). This is usually because a player is 
                    consistently serving at a level that the other team cannot pass. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This is the perfect time for you to start building passing fundamentals, including footwork, communication (calling 
                    seems and for the ball), and proper technique. This will put you a step ahead of someone who only 
                    has a good serve and prevent you from forming bad habits later on.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I would strongly recommend learning the rules of volleyball and the basics of rotation to once 
                    again prevent bad habits and increase your overall knowledge of the sport.
                </p>
                <h3>Intermediate Level</h3>
                <p>
                    At this point, you should know the basics of passing and properly understand the game of 
                    volleyball. The next step is to determine your position in the system. There are 6 positions: 
                    <br>
                    OH - Outside Hitter
                    <br>
                    OPP - Opposite (Right-side) Hitter
                    <br>
                    MB - Middle Blocker
                    <br>
                    S - Setter
                    <br>
                    L - Libero
                    <br>
                    DS/SS - Defensive/Serving Specialist
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    If you haven't already, I would highly recommend working out (specifically lower body and 
                    plyometrics for defense and jumping). Having a stronger body results in more control over yourself 
                    and over the volleyball.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    If possible, learn how to dive. Having this ability allows a defender to get as close to the 
                    ground as possible, leading to more digs and saves.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Understand blocking. Always go up with a reason, whether it be to take away court space from the 
                    hitter or to attack the attacker. A good blocker can adapt to an attacker and effectively 
                    communicate with their defense.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The intermediate level ramps up the level of communication throughout the game. The more 
                    knowledge you can share with your team, the better prepared your team will be (some examples are 
                    calling out whether the setter is front or back row, and where the hitters are lining up).
                </p>
                <h3>Advanced Level</h3>
                <p>At the advanced level, there is no limit to how far you can improve your ability. Physically, you 
                    can always be more explosive and controlled. Mentally, you can always be more calculating and 
                    concetrated. In volleyball, there are so many different ways to hone your style that it is 
                    impossible to do it all. Therefore, you must pick and choose. Build your own toolkit and play 
                    for fun. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As an outside hitter, my love for the game is hitting the ball as hard as I can and getting aces on the serving line. So I took the time to develop an advanced level top spin jump serve and practiced using my whole body when spiking the ball. Once you have defined your skill set, there are a few general parts of the game that are helpful as you face better competition.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Learn how to read the hitter. This will allow you to move faster on defense and get more digs. Learn advanced blocking. A common form of blocking in beach volleyball volleyball is dive blocking. This form of blocking can help in single blocker scenarios turning the block into an attack. Triple blocks are also common at the highest level. Learn how to play the game faster. Being able to see the ball earlier or starting your forward motion before the ball is struck can dramatically increase your movement speed and range of getable balls.
